                        Full stack development using Azure as the cloud service. 
                        I am currently a scrum master for a team re-developing an extremely old (VB) Insurance platform using Dynamics + a .NET 5 WebAPI. 
                        My role has predominantly been the .NET WebAPI and CI/CD side while helping out where I can on the Dynamics side.

                        At Enlighten I was part of the Data and AI team so worked mostly with Power BI and extending the limits of it, which was creating fun custom visuals (using D3 and React + Javascript). The other side was designing and creating reports to tell stories using data for the data journalism team at Microsoft as well as high-level KPI reports and dashboards for business leaders to inspire decision making. I also maintained our internal data warehouse using SSIS/SSAS + SQL on the side. In between Power BI projects I worked on custom web projects using React and .NET.
