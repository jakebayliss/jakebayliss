# Hey 👋

I'm a software engineer who lives in **.NET**, **React**, **Next.js**, and **Azure**.  
Recently I have spent my days rescuing and untangling a legacy VB codebase into a modern .NET platform hosted in Azure.

When I'm not wrangling code, you might find me:  
- 🏃‍♂️ Running 
- ♟️ Playing chess
- 📚 Reading

I enjoy making messy systems behave, building scalable solutions, and occasionally laughing at my own code 😅
